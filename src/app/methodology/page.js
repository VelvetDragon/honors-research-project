        <p>
          Scripts for the selected Disney films were sourced from reliable online databases such as <a href="https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Springfield! Springfield!</a> and <a href="https://imsdb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internet Movie Script Database (IMSDb)</a>. The selection criteria included films released between 1990 and 2020, encompassing a diverse range of genres and characters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each line of dialogue was meticulously extracted and tagged with the corresponding character‚Äôs identity, including attributes such as gender, race, and cultural background. This process was automated using custom Python scripts, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in data collection.

          <p>
            The collected dialogue data underwent a series of preprocessing steps to prepare it for sentiment analysis. This included:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Removal of non-verbal cues, stage directions, and irrelevant annotations to isolate the spoken dialogues.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Normalization:</strong> Standardizing the text by converting all characters to lowercase, removing punctuation, and eliminating stopwords to ensure consistency across the dataset.</li>
            <li><strong>Expanding Contractions:</strong> Converting contractions (e.g., &quot;don&apos;t&quot; to &quot;do not&quot;) to their expanded forms to maintain consistency and improve analysis accuracy.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These preprocessing steps were implemented using Python&apos;s NLTK library, which offers robust tools for natural language processing tasks.

          <h2>Sentiment Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Sentiment Analysis</strong>, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone behind a series of words. Sentiment analysis is the extraction of sentiment, opinions, and emotions from text. It aims to identify and categorize opinions expressed in a text, especially to determine the writer's attitude towards a particular topic, product, or context. <strong><sup><a href="/references/#cite5">5</a></sup></strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Originating from the need to analyze customer feedback and social media sentiments, sentiment analysis has evolved with advancements in machine learning and deep learning. Today, it encompasses various approaches, including lexicon-based methods and machine learning models.<strong><sup><a href="/references/#cite1">1</a></sup></strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            In this research, sentiment analysis serves as a pivotal tool to dissect and understand the emotional undertones embedded in Disney character dialogues. By quantifying emotions, the study aims to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Identify prevalent emotional expressions among different characters.</li>
            <li>Compare sentiment distributions across various demographic groups, such as gender, race, and cultural background.</li>
            <li>Uncover patterns that may either reinforce or challenge existing stereotypes in animated storytelling.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Sentiment analysis was conducted using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner).VADER sentiment is a rule-based and lexicon-based framework for sentiment analysis, with support for intensity estimation. The frameworks have performed as well as human raters on Twitter data <strong><sup><a href="/references/#cite4">4</a></sup></strong>. Further, VADER sentiment performed better or equally when compared against seven sentiment analysis lexicons.<strong><sup><a href="/references/#cite4">4</a></sup></strong> VADER was selected for its effectiveness in handling emoticons, slang, and the informal language often found in animated dialogues.
          </p>
          <p>
            Emotional expressions were categorized as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Positive:</strong> Emotions like joy and hope (e.g., üòä)</li>
            <li><strong>Neutral:</strong> Non-emotional, calm statements (e.g., üòê)</li>
            <li><strong>Negative:</strong> Emotions like anger and sadness (e.g., üò°)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each emotional tone was assigned a numerical value (+1 for positive, 0 for neutral, -1 for negative) or represented with emojis to facilitate comparative analysis and make the project more engaging.
          </p>
          <p>
            The VADER tool was integrated into the analysis pipeline using Python&apos;s <code>vaderSentiment</code> library, allowing for efficient and scalable sentiment scoring of extensive dialogue datasets.
